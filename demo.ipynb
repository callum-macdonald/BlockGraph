    "# Playing around with Blockchain Graphs\n",
    "We want to explore blockchain data in a more intuitive way using graphs.  We use the \"ShroomDK\" API from flipside crypto to make queries, and then use some graph network libraries to play with the results. To gain access to ShroomDK, visit [https://sdk.flipsidecrypto.xyz/shroomdk](https://sdk.flipsidecrypto.xyz/shroomdk) and mint your API key, use this as the \"my_key\" variable below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this is structured is that we are interested in following connections between wallets as far as it takes until we hit a labelled wallet. This way, we have information about known entities, and bunch of un-labelled addresses that might be of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General flow\n",
    "- Input a list of seed addresses from which we will grow a graph of transactions and associated wallets\n",
    "- Run SQL queries with ShroomDK to find all transactions involving those seed addresses, as well as looking for any address labels, and also check if any addresses are contracts or not.\n",
    "- We Then use NetworkX to produce a graph from these transactions. This creates node and edge objects from a dataframe of transactions\n",
    "- Using the address labels, we simplify the graph, e.g. if there are 10 different addresses associated with \"Binance\",  we represent them as a single node.\n",
    "- We can then enrich the graph with data about the nodes and edges (e.g total transaction volume between nodes, and net volume/direction)"
